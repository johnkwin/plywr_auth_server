                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>This policy covers what personally identifiable information 'List Assist' collects and how it is treated. Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify visitors, order information, and any web activity using the www.joinplayware.com Web Site. This information may be limited to an IP address or extend to personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email address, or phone number. By downloading and installing 'List Assist', you are agreeing that we may use information that we collect to help us provide the best possible service for our clients and partners. We collect order and traffic information from stores in order to conduct social sharing activity on their behalf, and track marketing performance.</p>

                <p>This policy only applies to 'List Assist' and does not extend to the practices of other Web Sites that we may link to, companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.</p>

                <h2>How We Keep Your Information Secure</h2>
                <p>The security of your information is important to us. We implement reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information.</p>

                <p>When we handle your sensitive information on the Internet we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). When dealing with payment transactions we process these through third party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) and rely on their security systems.</p>

                <p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur.</p>

                <p>It is important for you to take steps to keep your information safe and protect against unauthorized access to your Account, your password and to your computer.</p>

                <p>If you access our products and services from or through a SNS and your SNS account is hacked or other accessed by an unauthorized user, this may lead to unauthorized use of our products and services, so be careful to keep your SNS account information secure.</p>

                <h2>Contact Information</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about how we strive to keep your information secure, please contact us.</p>

                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>Cookies are a technology which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a Web Site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.

                <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
                <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
